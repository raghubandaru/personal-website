### Build Momentum

##### Motivation

- How difficult is it to get up and running with a goal?
- How many times people start learning new things or building new habits end abruptly?

I believe in consistency and accountability
during the process, especially in the beginning. It is the sheer
consistency over a period that builds momentum that accelerates
the process of achieving goals.

I chose to develop a minimal web app that demonstrates
technical skills and simulates the above process to fit my needs.
Each user can activate only one goal and work on it for a week.
Add the tasks that direct you towards the goal and stay
accountable through the progress of the week. Rinse and Repeat!

##### Technical Skills

- App is developed in MERN Stack. UI is written in React.js,
  Server Side API is written in Express.js (Node.js Web
  Application Framework) and Data is stored in MongoDB.
- Supports server side caching of the resources and is implemented
  using Redis.
- Authentication is implemented using Json Web Tokens. App uses
  Access tokens to authroize the user and Refresh tokens to
  generate additional Access tokens.
- Supports file upload and crop. Uploaded assets are stored in
  Cloudinary (Cloud based image and video management platform).
- Client side of the app uses React Context API for global state
  management. Focus is on utilizing component composition,
  building reusable components, lazy loading and prefetching
  components.
- Each active goal is valid till saturday midnight of that week.
  Custom Heroku Scheduler script takes care of automating and
  archiving all active goals of the week in a scalable manner.
