### Realtime TicTacToe

##### Motivation

- How about looking beyond Http protocol and CRUD based
  applications?
- How about building a game that integrates realtime
  features?

Exploring WebSockets is fun and powerful. There are
genuine use cases for it to thrive. While exploring WebSockets, I
came across a realtime engine called Socket.io that enables
bidirectional and event-based communication.

I chose to develop a minimal web app based on Socket.io.
Users can create a game or join the game started by someone with
the generated code. Happy playing!

##### Technical Skills

- App is developed in MERN Stack. UI is written in React.js,
  Server Side API is written in Express.js (Node.js Web
  Application Framework) and Data is stored in MongoDB.
- Real time communication is setup using Socket.io client and
  server technologies.
- Authentication is implemented using Json Web Tokens. App uses
  Access tokens to authroize the user and Refresh tokens to
  generate additional Access tokens.
- Supports file upload and crop. Uploaded assets are stored in
  Cloudinary (Cloud based image and video management platform).
- Client side of the app uses React Context API for global state
  management. Focus is on utilizing component composition,
  building reusable components, lazy loading and prefetching
  components.
- Supports gameplay using multiple connections(devices) and view
  player(opponent) statistics during gameplay.
