### Realtime TicTacToe

##### Motivation

- How about looking beyond Http protocol and CRUD based applications?
- How about building a game and integrating real-time features to it?

Exploring WebSockets is fun and powerful. There are genuine use cases for it to thrive. While exploring WebSockets, I came across a realtime engine called Socket.io that enables bidirectional and event-based communication.

I chose to develop a minimal web app based on Socket.io. Users can create a game or join the game started by someone with
the generated code. Happy playing!

##### Technical Skills

- Chose the MERN stack to build the application, I have developed UI in React.js, Server-side API in Express.js (Node.js Web Application Framework) and Database in MongoDB.
- JSON Web Token is used to implement authentication and authorization of the app. App uses Access tokens to authorize the user and Refresh tokens to generate additional access tokens.
- Real-time communication is setup using Socket.io client and
  server technologies.
- Supports file upload and crop, the uploaded assets are stored in the Cloudinary (Cloud-based image and video management platform).
- The client-side of the app uses React Context API for global state management. The focus is on utilizing component composition and building reusable components.
- Supports lazy loading and prefetching the components, thus only loading the necessary chunks.
- Styled-components (CSS-in-JS library) is used for styling.
- Supports gameplay using multiple connections(devices) and view
  player(opponent) statistics during gameplay.
