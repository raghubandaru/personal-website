### Statistics Covid19

##### Motivation

- How about stepping up the data with visualization?
- How about taking information and placing it into a visual context, such as a map or graph?

It is easier to identify patterns and trends with data visualization than pondering over thousands of rows right.

I chose to build a small web app based on global data available on the current pandemic COVID-19. Let's visualize!
